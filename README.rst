openedx-wallet
##############

A simple internal storage backend for Verifiable Credentials application within the Open edX Credentials service.

Note: implemented as a Credentials plugin.

Purpose
=======

Recently Open edX Credentials gained initial verifiable credentials support.
It's `verifiable_credentials` application allows creation (issuance) of verifiable credentials based on
the internally produced in Open edX ecosystem credentials (currently, achieved Program Certificates).

Learners are able to:

- **request an issuance** of a verifiable credential that "mirrors" internal Open edX credential;
- **upload** issued verifiable credential to an **external storage**;

Currently, the only implemented (built-in) storage is the Learner Record Wallet (mobile application).
The Learner Record Wallet usage configuration includes some semi-formal steps to start working on a particular
Open edX installation.

This plugin adds another optional storage backend that is aimed to serve as a playground for
the Verifiable Credentials feature.

Functionality outline
---------------------

The `openedx-wallet` plugin utilizes storages extension point of the `verifiable_credentials` app.
The plugin extends a list of available for usage verifiable credentials storages.

Prerequisites:

- Credentials service is configured with Verifiable Credentials feature enabled
- a new UI Ñ–s available within the Learner Record micro-frontend
- there must be at list 1 storage enabled for usage
- `openedx-wallet` backend is included to the default storages configuration

With active `openedx-wallet` backend another action button ("Download") becomes available within the Verifiable Credentials UI.
Action button label (e.g. "Download") is configurable.

Once learners click action button, instead of to be redirected to a mobile app (LC Wallet usage case), they are
navigated to the internal plugin's `wallet-setup` page that allows a manual interactive ("Verifiable Credential requirements"
web form) setup for further verifiable credential issuance.

When the "Verifiable Credential requirements" form is valid (see below), a learner is able to submit the issuance request.

A standard verifiable credential issuance process happens and a newly created artifact is returned in response.

On response learners are redirected to the another internal `wallet-result` page:

- issued verifiable credential is rendered (prettified JSON) within the result page;
- issued verifiable credential is available for download ("Save locally" button);

Verifiable Credential requirements form
---------------------------------------

An options could be:

- required - to set a subject DID;
- (optionally) to set a holder DID;
- (optionally) to force a data model to use (by default: VC Data Model | Open Badges v3.0);
- (optionally) to set expiration period;
- ...
- future: to compose verifiable presentations;
- future: to share with browser extension(s) - investigate on the "CHAPI" use cases;

Use cases
---------

onboarding
  - interested parties are able to investigate on a verifiable credentials nature;
  - interested parties are able to have a quick trial of the Open edX Verifiable Credentials feature (w/o LC Wallet prerequisites);

production use
  - learners - (in theory) want to download verifiable credentials for not yet integrated wallets (with the further import from a disk);

further development
  - QA/developers - future functionality extensions (new data models, new proof methods, etc.)
